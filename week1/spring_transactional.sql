Springâ€™s transaction mechanism provides a PlatformTransactionManager interface, Different data access technologies implement their different way from this interface.


 After using @EnableTransactionManagement, the Spring container automatically scans for methods and classes annotated @Transactional.

 @Transactional can be annotated not only on methods but also on classes. When annotated on a class, all public methods of that class are transaction-enabled. If both class-level and method-level @Transactional annotations are used, the annotation used at the method level overrides the class-level annotation.
